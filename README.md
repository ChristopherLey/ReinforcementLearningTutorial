# Reinforcement Learning Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of code for a series of tutorials on reinforcement learning I gave. 
The tutorials are written in Python and most use the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/content/basic_usage/) 
library for the environments.

# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

The PPO algorithm is a policy gradient method that is designed to be more stable than the vanilla policy gradient method.

To train the PPO algorithm, run the following command:
```console
python PPO/main.py --training
```
to test the PPO algorithm, run the following command:
```console
python PPO/main.py
```
