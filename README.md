# Reinforcement Learning Tutorials

This repository contains a collection of code for a series of tutorials on reinforcement learning I gave. 
The tutorials are written in Python and most use the 
library for the environments.

# Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

The PPO algorithm is a policy gradient method that is designed to be more stable than the vanilla policy gradient method.

To train the PPO algorithm, run the following command:
```console
python PPO/main.py --training
```
to test the PPO algorithm, run the following command:
```console
python PPO/main.py
```
## Help
All `gym` environments are used through the Farma.org [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/content/basic_usage/) toolbox.

All Mujoco environments are used through _"Google DeepMind Infrastructure for Physics-Based Simulation"_ toolbox. For more information on how to install the 
`dm_control` toolbox, please visit their [GitHub](https://github.com/google-deepmind/dm_control/tree/main)
