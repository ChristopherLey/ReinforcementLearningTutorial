    "- Agent begins at `START` and must navigate to `GOAL` without falling into a hole. \n",
    "- The agent can move in one of four directions: `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `UP`, `DOWN`. \n",
    "- The agent receives a reward of `1` for reaching the `GOAL` and a reward of `0` otherwise. \n",
    "- Because the surface is slippery, the agent has a 0.33 probability of moving in the intended direction and the other 2/3 is split between the other directions. \n",
    "- Finally, there is a fence around the lake, so the agent cannot move off the grid, if it tries to move off the grid it will stay in the same spot. \n",
    "- Falling in a hole is a terminal state and the agent will be rewarded a score of `0`.\n",
